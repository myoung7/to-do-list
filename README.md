## To-Do List
Simple iOS app designed to add items to-do in a table view. One of my first iOS applications. Created before I had any knowledge of Core Data.

Features
- Type and add items to-do in one tab view.
- View list of to-do items in another tab view.

Application is operational, but lacking some key GUI elements. 
To run, import project into Xcode. Functions on iPhone and iPad.

Possible New Features
- Implement Core Data instead of using NSUserDefaults.
